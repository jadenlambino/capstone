# Welcome to JAILED!
Jailed is a full stack clone of the popular clothing webiste Grailed. I decided to use this website as inspiration because I love the styling of it and I am very passionate about all things fashion and streetwear. On Jailed, users are able to browse, shop, and sell their items.
